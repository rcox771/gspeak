# gspeak

This is just a simple no fuss wrapper around gTTS that plays buffers directly using pygame. I had found some articles with people posting various solutions, but this is the only one that I could get to work. I figured I might as well make it available for others too.

## Quickstart

```python
from gspeak import speak

speak("yo dog what it is")
```

## Install

```bash
pip install gspeak
```
